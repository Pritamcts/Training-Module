Chat-Bot Project
This project is a chat-bot built using Django, Pinecone vector database, OpenAI, and LangChain. The user interface is implemented using Streamlit. The chat-bot leverages a custom knowledge base to provide responses.

Features
Django: Backend framework to manage the application.
Pinecone: Vector database to manage and search through embeddings.
OpenAI: For natural language understanding and response generation.
LangChain: To facilitate the interaction between the language model and the knowledge base.
Streamlit: For creating an interactive and user-friendly UI.
